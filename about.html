                    Hey there! This is Moosa Raza, a Developer and a Freelancer from Pakistan.
                    First of all I would like to welcome you & thank you from the bottom of my heart for visiting my
                    website.
                    As you all know my name but I would like to introduce myself in detail on this platform. <br><br>
                    Let's begin with the age so, I'm 19 years old and doing my Bachelors in Computer Science from UBIT a
                    well-known & esteemed institute specially in IT field at University of Karachi.
                    Simultaneously, I'm making some practical applications because in this era every student must have
                    to practice that what they had learn. So, this is my suggestion for all students. I'm also a student
                    that's why I said suggestion because
                    I'm not a teacher but I think it's my responsibility as a student to share my experience from you
                    people. <br><br>
                    I always try to approach in the way which increases my experience and clear my concepts, so to
                    follow this I simply think any idea or take any example question from internet which can I convert
                    into the source code through my logic because as the saying goes <span>practice makes man perfect!</span> <br><br>
                    On the other hand, I'm doing Web & Hybrid Mobile application development online course from one of
                    the best institute of Pakistan named Saylani Mass Training Program. I'm the person who wants to
                    learn different courses regarding my Computer Science field because I know it will help me in my
                    freelancing career as well as in my Computer Science Career because I'm interested in the development
                    phase. <br><br>
                    I think that's all about my field and I feel that I'm very lucky because I selected the right field
                    at the right time. Because I think every one should decide their Professional field according to
                    their interest & once you decide than go ahead with that particular field and give your 100%
                    potential & efforts to that field otherwise you cannot creatively work in that particular field you
                    have selected. <br><br>
                    Now let's have a look to this website which I had made to show my work to you guys. This is my first
                    live website after learning Online Web Development Course. This is based on HTML 5, CSS 3,
                    Javascript and bootstrap. I know its very simple but in the making of this web I have learned many
                    things which increases & boost my interest and my experience in the Website Development Field.
                    One more thing is that I know you are thinking about how I explaining myself here and also I know
                    that everybody is not liking my words and all these stuff which I explained because I'm not good
                    with words at all. I specially mention this point, I feel it's necessary because I'm programmer not
                    a philosopher or grammer teacher XD. Don't take it serious it is just a joke..! <br><br>
                    In the end, I am thankful to you for reading about myself. <br><br>
                    Best Regards...
                </p>
